# About Us

MonsterEOS was born as an experimental decentralized application in the EOS Blockchain. It is a Tamagotchi style game where you keep your pets alive and happy by feeding them, providing a pleasant environment, and letting them rest. By popular demand and adoption from the EOS community, we have added requested features such as battles and a monster market.

The project will ALWAYS be open source because we believe itâ€™s a must for a decentralized world, and also, because we want the project to be building block and code reference for other great games and dapps on the EOS blockchain. In fact, we encourage everyone to browse our code repository, and extend/modify the game and re-publish as you wish - the more dapps built for our wonderful EOS community the better.

## Contributing to the project

## Technical Strategy

### Branching

- `master`: we don't develop on it, it's only for released versions
- `staging`: it's for bug fixes, current issues fixing, prior deployment to master, **this is where mostly you will branch out and submit PRs**
- `develop`: it's for new project versions, new gaming features etc

### CI/CD

It's a really important TODO item. With the project and members growing more and more we need to implement some hooks for linting and tests check. Let us know if you want to work on that!
