## Battle Arena Creation Terms & Conditions

I, {{host}}, agree to host a battle arena in order to
fight other players pets in a {{mode}}v{{mode}} mode.

I also commit to submit my secret hash with my monsters
selection and I agree to reveal it whenever my enemy player
join my arena, being ready to wait for his reveal and start
the fun battle.

I understand that this arena is just a fun game mode that
will never hurt or kill my monster pet.

I understand that monsters transfers are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
