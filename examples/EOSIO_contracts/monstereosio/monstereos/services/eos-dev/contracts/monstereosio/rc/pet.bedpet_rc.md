## Monster Sleep Terms & Conditions

I, the owner of the pet {{pet_id}}, am putting this monster of
id {{pet_id}} to sleep in order to rest and recover its energy.

I understand that I cannot wake it again in the next 4 hours.

I understand that monsters actions are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
