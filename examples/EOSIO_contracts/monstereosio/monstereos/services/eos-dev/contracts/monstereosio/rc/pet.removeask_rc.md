## Monster Order Removal Terms & Conditions

I, {{owner}}, the owner of the pet {{pet_id}}, am removing entirely
a sell order, willing to cancel the transfer of the ownership
of it.

I understand that monsters transfers are not reversible after the
{{$transaction.delay_sec}} seconds or other delay as configured
by my own permissions.

If this action fails to be irreversibly confirmed for technical issues
or failure, I agree that I need to attempt to submit this action again,
and also the subsequent interactions that I could possibly being submitted
in this interval.
