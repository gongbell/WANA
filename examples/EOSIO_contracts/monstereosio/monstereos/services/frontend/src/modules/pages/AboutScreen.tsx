## About
MonsterEOS was born as an experimental decentralized application in the EOS Blockchain. It is a Tamagotchi style game where you keep your pets alive and happy by feeding them, providing a pleasant environment, and letting them rest. By popular demand and adoption from the EOS community, we have added requested features such as battles and a monster market.

The project will ALWAYS be open source because we believe it’s a must for a decentralized world, and also, because we want the project to be building block and code reference for other great games and dapps on the EOS blockchain. In fact, we encourage everyone to browse our code repository, and extend/modify the game and re-publish as you wish - the more dapps built for our wonderful EOS community the better.

The game is currently in **BETA**, and under constant development and improvement. This does not restrict us from implementing profit channels to fund the required resources and team. For now, the project receives 1% of all the market transfers and we are studying ways of implementing in-app purchases avoiding PAY-TO-WIN schemes.

Many crypto-world games are based on a gambling scheme. These have a place in the market, but our goal for MonsterEOS is for folks to just have FUN, period. It's okay to create monsters, raise them, love them and then exchange them. That's why we have a market, but we aren't intending MonsterEOS to be second source of income for people, besides... You will probably love your monsters too much to part with them.

We love the EOS Community and we know that we can build a better world together!

The project is open to the public and we welcome anyone who would like to collaborate. Our Github repository is there for the community, but in order to receive shares of the project and participate in our distribution, you must be approved by board members.

Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization is still being defined but [you can check out our current proposal here](https://github.com/MonsterEOS/dao/blob/master/README.md). This model is inspired by Slicing Pie for startup companies, and we believe that it’s the fairest way to reward collaborators of an open source project. We intend to translate our agreement into an EOS Smart Contract and automate the distribution process in the future.
