      <strong>
        I created my monster, it's sleeping and I can't interact with, what
        should I do?
      </strong>
      <br />
      It's the spawning time, every time your pet is sleeping it needs a minimum
      period of 4 hours to rest and be awake again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why my pet does not want to eat?</strong>
      <br />
      Your pet is full, it needs at least an interval of 3 hours before you feed
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why my pet does not want to sleep?</strong>
      <br />
      Your pet is not tired, it needs to be at least 8 hours awake to go sleep
      again!
