The game operates in rounds. A new round (kingdom) begins whenever the `init` or `end` action is called. This contract's account is set as the first _king_ of this round with a starting price of `1.0000 EOS`. Any EOS account can become the new king by sending `1.35x` the last price as an `eosio.token::transfer` action to the contract account. The old king loses his king status and receives funds equal to `(1.3/1.35)x` the price the new king paid (`1.3x` the price the _old king_ paid himself). These funds are transfered immediately as a response to the transfer action through another `eosio.token::transfer` action sent from the contract account to the previous king's account. Anyone can end and start a new round by calling this contract's `end` action 7 (seven) days after the latest king coronation. The last king of the old round is not entitled to any funds being paid out in the new round. The author disclaims all liability for the operation of the contract. No refunds or compensation will be paid. It's up to the block producers to resolve a dispute that does not conform to the intentions set by this contract's and its actions ricardian clauses."
