## EOS Shine SmartContract

This document describes various aspects of the EOS Shine SmartContract
implementation ranging from architecture, building, troubleshooting, etc.

Moreover, this document also contains various information about EOS
SmartContract in general, mainly aimed at the developer audience.

### Architecture & Features

The Shine contract goal is to enable the implementation of a recognition
system based on praise and votes. Person (i.e. account) broadcast a praise
to all other members. Each member (i.e. account) can then vote for this
particular praise.

#### Actions

* `praise` (`addpraise`) - Create a praise in the blockchain.
* `vote` (`addvote`) - Vote for a given praise in the blockchain.
* `rewards` (`calcrewards`) - Update the rewards table in the blockchain.

### Development

#### Prerequisites

For development, ideally you would have a testnet running on your machine
executing the EOS blockchain by configuring a local environment. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Local-Environment and when you have a `nodeos`
running with a producer emitting blocks, come back here.

There is a `shine_bot.rb` script that enables to interact with the contract
in a more rapid way. For this you will need Ruby 2.4+ installed along with the
following dependency installed globally:

```
gem install 'tty-prompt'
```

Note that this is not needed if you don't plan on using the

#### Preparation

Let's prepare for the development of EOS Shine SmartContract. We will
need an account on a running blockchain. It's quite possible to run
you own test blockchain on your machine for development purposes.

Let's create the account by creating two EOS key sets (first one for owner
permission second one for active permission). Note the private keys outputted
somewhere as we will need them in later section:

**Note** You will need to have `eosios@active` private key imported into a
wallet for the account creation to work. Import it using `cleos wallet import <private_key>`.

```
# Owner
cleos create key
Private key: 5H123
Public key: EOSXYZ

# Active
cleos create key
Private key: 5B456
Public key: EOSABC

cleos create account eosio shine EOSXYZ EOSABC
```

Once the account is created, let's import the owner and active private keys
into the default wallet (you are free to use another wallet also):

**Note** Ensures that the wallet is unlocked prior doing this operation. You
can unlock it by using `cleos wallet unlock` and entering the wallet password
that was outputted at wallet creation time.

```
# Of course, change 5H123 and 5B456 by real owner & active private keys respectively
cleos wallet import 5H123
cleos wallet import 5B456
```

We are then good to go. Note that if the blockchain node is stopped,
wallet will need to be unlocked again prior doing any operations
in the upcoming sections.

#### Building & Testing

Building the SmartContract ABI and code to WAST is performed through
the `eosiocpp` command line utility. Navigate to the root folder
of this project and then issue:

```
eosiocpp -o shine.wast shine.cpp
```

Once the WAST has been generated correctly, next step is to set the contract
on the account `shine` that was created in the preparation step:

```
cleos set contract shine `pwd`
```

##### Testing

To make it easier to develop, the `shine_bot.rb` is a small command line
utility to interact more easily with the SmartContract.

First, it's possible to run all command in a quick way by passing the flag
`-q` to the CLI tool. This will not ask for question for which a default value
has been provided by via environment variables. Environment variables for the
various questions:

* SHINE_BOT_CONTRACT - Default value of the contract id
* SHINE_BOT_ACTION - Default action to execute (use in preference CLI arguments instead of this one)
* SHINE_BOT_AUTHOR - Default member that posted a praise
* SHINE_BOT_PRAISEE - Default member praised in a praise
* SHINE_BOT_VOTER - Default member that voted for a praise
* SHINE_BOT_PRAISE_ID - Default praise id to use when voting
* SHINE_BOT_REWARD_POT - Default EOS reward amount (in form `#.XXXX EOS`)

Action can also be specified via the CLI, this is the preferred way of
performing an action.

Without any argument, contract and action will be asked via the terminal.
So it's recommended to export `SHINE_BOT_CONTRACT` so the question is not
ask at all (even without quick mode flag `-q`). With the right action flag
(or environment variable), the contract and action will not be asked
and default value will be used.

When entering member id in questions, you can use any string value. The input
defined will then be hashed using `sha256` and this will result in
the `member_id` being pass to the contract.

Possible usage:

* `./shine_bot.rb --praise` - Perform a praise (author, praisee, memo)
* `./shine_bot.rb --vote` - Perform a vote (praise_id, voter)
* `./shine_bot.rb --rewards` - Compute the rewards (pot)
* `./shine_bot.rb --scenario` - Perform a scenario adding 6 praises and 10 votes.

By using the scenario, you will automatically add a bunch of praises and
votes so it's easier to test your SmartContract code and changes afterward.

### EOS SmartContract

#### References

This section aims at providing links to documentation related to some concept
of building SmartContract for the EOS blockchain.

* `eosio::multi_index`

  Currently, the EOS `multi_index` is poorly documented. Suggestion is to
  check out [boost::multi_index](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial)
  documentation since `eosio::multi_index` API is heavily based on it.

  Otherwise, looking at the [eosio::multi_index source](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosiolib/multi_index.hpp).

#### Table Update

Updating an existing table is problematic right now as it appears (unconfirmed)
that serialization of the data is performed in a sequential binary way. This
causes problem when serialization/deserialization back the new table structure.

Indeed, probably that under the cover, field names are not included in the
serialized form. Deserialization then expects a certain layout to allow
correct deserialization.

As such, when a field that is being added to an existing table will likely
causing read error since not enough bytes will be available to fill the
structure completely. This results in the following error message when
trying to post an action that interacts with this table:

```
Error 3030000: transaction validation exception
Ensure that your transaction satisfy the contract's constraint!
Error Details:
condition: assertion failed: read
```

When a field is instead removed, then there it's likely that there will
not be any runtime error as bytes will simply be re-interpreted as whatever
the target type expect. This will causes logical error since the data held
by the struct will be all scrambled (for example, a count value of `1` could
become `7956005066189463816` since 8 random bytes will be re-interpreted to
a `uint64_t` which might give anything).

#### Set Contract Code Update

There is some limitations as speaking (10th April 2018) about code update
and doing a `set contract` command on an existing contract.

Limitations:

* Adding only a field to a `struct` does not update the code version
  giving `account.code_version != code_id: contract is already running this version of code`
  error message when trying to update the contract.

#### Set Contract Common Mistakes

* Test when

* ABI JSON Wrong Floating Type

  The correct way in the ABI JSON to represents a floating point
  number is to use `float64` which maps to `double` in the C++ code.
  Using `double` or `float` will result in the following cryptic error:

  ```
  Error 3030000: transaction validation exception
  Ensure that your transaction satisfy the contract's constraint!
  Error Details:
  is_type(a.second):
  ```

* ABI JSON Table Name Mismatch

  In your C++ contract, if you make a type in the `multi_index` table
  name when defining the `multi_index` `typedef` like this:

  ```
  typedef eosio::multi_index<N(tablename), card> card_index;
  ```

  If `tablename` has a mismatch with regarding the table name ABI
  definition, then at runtime it will work but access to the
  table via the CLI will not work since it will say table does not
  exist.

* ABI JSON Table Missing Fields

  If the `ABI` table definition has mismatch between actual code
  `struct` and definition, consequences will firstly the when querying
  the table data back, JSON representation will be broken.

  For an actual C++ definition of:

  ```
  struct {
    account_name owner;
    uint64_t value1;
    uint64_t value2;
  }
  ```

  And a table ABI definition of:

  ```
  {
    "owner": "account_name",
    "value2": "uint64"
  }
  ```

  A data of containing `{owner:john,value1:1,value2:2}`, the call
  `cleos get table contract contract table` results in:

  ```
  {
    "rows": [{
      "owner": "john",
      "value2": "1"
    }],
    "more": "false"
  }
  ```

* `EOSLIB_SERIALIZE` mismatch field(s)

  Let's say you added a field to an existing `struct` in your C++ code and also
  in the ABI but you forgot to add to the serialization of the struct, this results
  in no error when setting the contract and will instead cause runtime problem.

  For example, an `account` struct with fields `owner` and `player` where the
  EOS serialization call would be `EOSLIB_SERIALIZE(account, (owner))`. This will
  lead to runtime problem where `player` won't be initialized.

#### Set Contract Common Errors

* Error generated by `cleos set contract <account> <contract_folder>`
  when an action name is not respecting the base32 naming convention of EOS:

  ```
  Reading WAST...
  Assembling WASM...
  Error 3120001: Invalid name
  Name should be less than 13 characters and only contains the following symbol .12345abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  Error Details:
  Name not properly normalized (name: createv6, normalized: createv)
  Fail to parse ABI JSON
  ```

* Error generated by `cleos set contract <account> <contract_folder>`
  when an action is present but the associated struct of the action
  is not present in the `.abi` file:

  ```
   Reading WAST...
   Assembling WASM...
   Publishing contract...
   Error 3030000: transaction validation exception
   Ensure that your transaction satisfy the contract's constraint!
   Error Details:
   is_type(a.second):
  ```

* Error generated by `cleos set contract <account> <contract_folder>`
  when a table definition is present (i.e. `accounts`) but the associated
  struct of the stored data is not present (i.e. `account`) in the `.abi` file:

  ```
   Reading WAST...
   Assembling WASM...
   Publishing contract...
   Error 3030000: transaction validation exception
   Ensure that your transaction satisfy the contract's constraint!
