# Create your own EOS account easily using the open-sourced non-service-fee DApp: “signupeoseos”

Most EOS wallets have shut down their free EOS account registration service recently due to the increasing cost of EOS RAM. Some unreliable third-party agents claim to help register EOS accounts for other people but steal private keys and assets instead.

We create this [open-sourced](https://github.com/Dappub/signupeoseos) DApp called “signupeoseos” to help you create you own EOS account in a fast way easily without charging you extra service fee and this DApp has been integrated in many popular mobile EOS wallets (TokenPocket, Meet.one) as an underlying smart contract.

### How to register

As shown in the below screenshot:

*Signup via a simple exchange (Bitfinex) withdraw*

You only need to withdraw around 2 EOS ( the exact amount might vary based on the EOS RAM price) to our DApp address: [**signupeoseos**](https://eosflare.io/account/signupeoseos). Remember to fill in the “MEMO field” with the 12-bit EOS account name that you want to create, followed by your public key address (separated by the minus sign “-”)

If you don’t know how to create your EOS key pair, you can try [EOS Key Generation](https://nadejde.github.io/eos-token-sale) or [Scatter](https://get-scatter.com). You can search in any EOS blockchain explorer (e.g. [eosflare.io](https://eosflare.io/)) to check if your desired account name exists or not.

You can create your account by a simple transfer or withdraw operation and check the created account info on “eosflare.io” or “eospark.com”.

*An created EOS account (irisiloveyou) info on “eosflare.io“*

The DApp will register the account for you without charging extra service fee. Among the 2 EOS that you transfer to us, 0.1 EOS is staked for the CPU resource, another 0.1 EOS is staked for the bandwidth resource, and all the remaining 1.8 EOS will be used to purchase EOS RAM for your newly created EOS account. Also, if you’d like to buy more EOS RAM for investment purpose, you could transfer more than 2 EOS, all additional EOS will be used for buying EOS RAM for your account. In this way, you can invest EOS RAM without an EOS wallet at all.

*Actions of Dapp “signupeoseos” on “eosflare.io”*

As you can see, all registration operations are done by our DApp “signupeoseos” on the EOS blockchain automatically once you finished the transfer/withdraw operation. If you have any problem, you can refer to our open-sourced Github repo or contact us via our Telegram or Discord.

### Frequently asked questions:

**Q: Can I register by a simple transfer operation or withdrawing from exchanges other than Bitfinex?**

Yes, basically a normal EOS transfer would also work. As for withdrawing from some other exchanges such as “huobi”, there might be uppercase character restriction for the MEMO field, which is not supported for now.

**Q: Is there a service-fee charged by “signupeoseos”?**

No. “signupeoseos” is a DApp and you can check the details on the EOS network.

**Q: Will I lose my EOS if I transfer inadequate EOS?**

No, unsuccessful registration will fail the entire transfer transaction and you will not lose any EOS.

**Q: What if I transfer more EOS than necessary?**

All additional EOS will be used for purchasing EOS RAM for you newly created account. User will not lose any EOS.

**Q: What if I fill in the wrong format in the MEMO field during the transfer?**

If the MEMO comment format is incorrect, it will fail the entire transfer transaction and you will not lose your EOS.
